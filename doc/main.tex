        \textbf{Abstract:}
        With recent advances in quantum computing, post-quantum cryptographic algorithms are being actively deployed in real-world applications.
        For Ethereum, a transition to post-quantum cryptography would require replacing many primitives, including the \textsf{BLS12-381} signature schemes used by validators on the beacon chain.
Because \BLS leverages its bilinear pairing property to aggregate multiple validator signatures, enabling both performance improvements and
space savings, its replacement presents a particular challenge.
Furthermore, the bilinearity of the pairing function also enables straightforward threshold signatures, which are fundamental to distributed validator solutions.
The objective of this report is to review the current state of post-quantum signature algorithms and identify those most suitable for the Ethereum beacon chain, particularly focusing on their support for signature aggregation and threshold functionality.
