\section{Future work}

\begin{enumerate}
	%\item Benchmark distributed hash in a "real" setting (i.e. not in a LAN network) in both serial and parallel ways
	\item Benchmark with other protocols that are not natively supported by MP-SPDZ.
	\item Investigate on the right security model. Malicious security seems a must but should we aim for (two-thirds?) honest majority or dishonest majority? 
	%\item Add details on Sbox optimization to save communication rounds (i.e. cubes)
	%\item Specify somewhere that although all hash chains are precomputed, interaction is still needed to agree on random
\end{enumerate}
