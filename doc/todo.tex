\section{TODO}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Investigate on the generation of Beaver triples, both offline \& online for the MASCOT protocol
	\item Investigate on the memory usage of Beaver triples in the context of MASCOT
	\item Benchmark distributed hash in a "real" setting (i.e. not in a LAN network) in both serial and parallel ways
	\item Investigate whether we should rely on malicious security for both DKG and signature generation or if we could consider a more relaxed security model
	\item Add details on Sbox optimization to save communication rounds (i.e. cubes)
	%\item Specify somewhere that although all hash chains are precomputed, interaction is still needed to agree on random
\end{enumerate}
